libsimplepgp is a library for loading PGP keys and decrypting PGP messages.

Instead of aiming to support the entire OpenPGP standard, as GnuPG does, this 
project aims to support only the most common PGP message formats used for 
encrypting e-mail messages.  

Initial goals are:
 * Parse secret and public keys
 * Store secret keys in an in-memory keychain
 * Decrypt message formats commonly found in e-mail communication:
   - DSA/Elgamal asymmetric keys
   - TripleDES, CAST5, and AES-256 symmetric ciphers
   - SHA-1 hashes
   - ZIP and ZLIB compression
   
Known limitations:
 * No support for RSA keys
 * No support for creating messages (encryption)
 * No support for validating signatures
 * No support for old formats, or deprecated message types

Note that this is a C library, but currently the build script is an Xcode 
project for OS X.  I want the code to be semi-portable, but this library is a 
subset of an iOS project.
